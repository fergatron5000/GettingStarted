This code is rooted in the CIRC-01 project from ARDX for running on the Arduino platform with the circuit outlined either here or at http://ardx.org/CIRC01.

This is a very simple circuit, so this is me taking some time to play around with it.  This repo contains several Arduino sketches and the simple circuit diagram drawn and exported from Schemeit (http://www.digikey.com/schemeit).

Sketch Descriptions:
  
  Digital Blink: My copy of the initial code example.
  Analog Fade: My quick modification to do analog fading of the LED in and out.
